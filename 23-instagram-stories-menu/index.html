            Instagram Stories Menu
            Instagram “stories” are slideshows of photos, memes, and text. 
            Each element in the example represents a user who has posted a story. 
            The state of each story is communicated visually via the color of its border. 
            Create 3 classes that can be added to the .story element to visually indicate the state of each story:
            .new - add gradient border to show story has NOT yet been viewed
            .viewed - adds gray border to show story has been viewed
            .live - adds red notification badge, to show user is currently live streaming
