            Instagram Stories Menu
            Instagram “stories” are slideshows of photos, memes, and text. 
            Each element in the example represents a user who has posted a story. 
            The state of each story is communicated visually via the color of its border. 
            Create 3 classes that can be added to the .story element to visually indicate the state of each story:

            .new - add gradient border to show story has NOT yet been viewed
            .viewed - adds gray border to show story has been viewed
            .live - adds red notification badge, to show user is currently live streaming


            Hints
            A gradient border effect can be accomplished using a wrapping div 
            (note that the border-image property will not work properly with border radius)
            How you add the “LIVE” badge if that text doesn’t already exist in the DOM? 
            Trying using a pseudo element and the content property
