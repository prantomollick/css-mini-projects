        Search input > Takes 1/3 of the width of it's container

        when the user clicks into the search bar:
        >input grows to entire width of it's parent container with smooth transition
        > shrinks back to original size when user clicks away 
        > blue border
        > bonus: placeholder text is not visible when user clicks inside the search bar

        > accessibility
        for Accessibility, form inputs should always have a label. create a label with a valid for attribute

        > look up some css rule no need to write it yourself
        that hide the search input's label visually but keeps in accessible to screen readers
        -->

            <label for="search-field" class="hide">Search</label>
