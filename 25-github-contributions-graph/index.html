        Github Contributions Graph
        The HTML for the graph is generated by the code in index.js. You don't need to worry about how the code works (unless you want to!).

        The graph has 7 squares in each column, representing each day of the week, and 52 squares in each row, representing each week of the year.

        Style the graph with default squares. Then create selectors that will style each square based on the number of contributions per day. The JS code randomly each square a contribution level of 0, 3, 5, or 10, which is assigned using a data property. The lighter the color, the greater the number of contributions for that day.
